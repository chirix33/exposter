It is often used to improve exercise performance and muscle mass. Creatine is involved in making energy for muscles. About 95% of it is found in skeletal muscle. The majority of sports supplements in the US contain creatine. People who have lower creatine levels when they start taking creatine seem to get more benefit than people who start with higher levels.", "Lavet"),

Even if you only have 30 minutes, using your time wisely can help you get results, especially with a routine focused on gradual progression. Maximizing your time often means combining cardiovascular exercise and strength training in the same session. But should you do cardio before or after weights? There are some important factors that can help you decide.", "Kristi")
